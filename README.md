# Free Weight

## Description

Our motivation for our proect was to make an application that anyone could use for tracking their gym exercises and progression. With our application you are capable of making an account and storing information about your workouts. The info you can store includes the amount of reps you did and weight you used, as well as the names of the excerise that you did. This all will help you maintain your routine but also see your progession with it over time. Some of the challenges we faced during this were some debugging issues on the overall project. Another challenge involed some of the setting up multiple pages to get routed back to a single one. The problem that we solved with our app is helping anyone keep track of their workouts and progression over multiple sessions regardless of how often between your visits.
